The world is changed.

I feel it in the water.

I feel it in the earth.

(A han noston ned gwilith.)

I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.</p>
  <p>It began with the forging of the Great Leagues.</p>
  <p>One was given to the Seasonal Leaguers, shortest, wisest and easiest of all leagues.</p>
  <p>One to the Redrafters, great drafters and managers of the renewing leagues.</p>
  <p>And One, one league was gifted to the race of plebs and sussy baka's, who above all else desire free leagues.</p>
  <p>For within these leagues was bound the strength and the will to govern each race.</p>
  <p>But they were all of them deceived, for another league was made.</p>
  <p>Deep in the app of Sleeper, the Dark Lord Patocal forged a master league, and into this league he poured his draft addiction, his greed and his will for a never-ending dynasty.</p>
  
  

  
  <p>One League To Rule Them All.</p>
